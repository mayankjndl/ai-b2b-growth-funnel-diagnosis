# AI-Augmented B2B Growth Funnel Diagnosis

This project explores how AI prompting can be used as a strategic tool to diagnose and fix
B2B growth funnel breakdowns, rather than as a surface-level copywriting aid.

## Problem Context
Multiple outbound campaigns were generating leads but failing to convert effectively from
SQL to client. The objective was to identify where message–market fit, trust, or decision
structure was breaking down across the funnel.

## What This Project Covers
- Prompt engineering using AIDCA and behavioural principles
- Persona-specific growth messaging (Pharma COO, D2C Growth Lead)
- Funnel debugging across Lead → MQL → SQL → Client
- Designing boardroom-level dashboards focused on leadership decisions
- Using AI as a reasoning partner for strategy iteration

## Key Frameworks Used
- AIDCA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Conviction, Action)
- Message–Market Fit
- Cialdini’s Principles of Persuasion

## Outcome
The project demonstrates how structured prompting and funnel diagnosis can improve trust,
relevance, and conversion clarity without increasing lead volume.
